# Scott Schaffter's Portfolio Site

A place outlining things I've been working on and interested in. 

Built with Gatsby. I wanted to play with React based static site compilers because it seemed interesting. I figured I'd use something like styled components for styling as well given it seems to be the way things are going these days. 

The site is very much a work in progress and will be tracking issues / areas Im working on in the project area.
