# Scott Schaffter's Portfolio Site

A place outlining things I've been working on and interested in. 

Built with Gatsby. I wanted to play with React based static site compilers because it seemed interesting. I liked Gatsby's GraphQL approach to managing data and ability to tie into other APIs / CMSes like WordPress. I figured I'd use something like styled components for styling as well given it seems to be the way things are going these days. So this was somewhat of an excuse to play with new shiny objects.

The site is very much a work in progress and will be tracking issues / areas Im working on in the project area.
