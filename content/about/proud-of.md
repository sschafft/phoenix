- **Helping build Musaid.org** with my brother and help kick off the workshop model that is now thriving
- **Building Bivee** and helping teams in international development take on a more agile, customer-centered approach to what they are doing.
- **Gateway Academy** - the team, product, and working environment is definitely something I proud of
