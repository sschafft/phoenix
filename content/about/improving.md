title: What I am working on improving
order: 6

- **Getting to a place where I am ok with myself** and where I can feel comfortable in being vulnerable, accept & acknowledge my insecurities to be able to surmount them. I think managing yourself is a constant thing to work on, it's not a check the box exercise, its a practice.
- **Doing one thing at a time.** I think I’ve learned a lot over the years and I think if nothing else has stood out its that focus is king. I struggle with that at times. 
- **Balance.** I feel like I'm constantly swinging from one thing to the next, and I struggle at times to build the re-prioritization and time for reflection to help ensure that balance is somehow maintained. 
- **Learning** new programming languages and getting better at the ones I’ve worked with. I think it's a constant battle to keep even remotely sharp in the tech scene and I try my best to keep up with the whirlwind without trying to get caught in the hype of the next best JS framework to come out this week.
