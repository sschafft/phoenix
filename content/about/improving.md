title: What I am working on improving

- **I’m still working on that last bullet point** from the list above. It’s a practice, not an end state.
- **Doing one thing at a time.** I think I’ve learned a lot over the years and the need for focus is one of my biggest lessons. I struggle with that at times. 
- **Learning** new programming languages and getting better at the ones I’ve worked with. I think it's a constant battle to keep even remotely sharp in the tech scene and I try my best to keep up with the whirlwind without trying to get caught in the hype of the next best JS framework to come out this week.
