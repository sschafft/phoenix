If you are predominantly wanting to know about me professionally, you probably want to just checkout my <a href="/resume" target="_blank">resume</a>. 

This page is partly space for me to share who I am, what I care about and help round out who I am for people trying to figure out who I am on the interwebs. Its also part reflective journal as a way for me to reflect on who I am, what I care about, where I focus and partially a way to own being vulnerable and sharing openly. 

As a result, it's long-winded and will likely change periodically as I have introspective moments. So apologies in advance and hey, if you stick around, thanks for taking the time to get to know me a bit better.
