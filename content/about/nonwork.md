I was born in Bangkok, Thailand and lived in a small town on the border of Cambodia ([Aranyaprathet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aranyaprathet)) for the first 6 years of life while my parents worked with Cambodian refugees during the Khmer Rouge crisis. We then moved to Vietnam, Romania, and India where I finished high school in Bangalore. I went on to volunteer in El Salvador for a year, finish undergrad at UBC in Vancouver, moved to Washington DC and, I now live in Denver with my son Calvin and wife Taylor. I continued to visit my parents during their subsequent postings to Kyrgyzstan, Laos and finally North Korea. They finally retired to Chaingmai, Thailand.

I love the outdoors and moved to Denver to mostly be closer to the mountains and nature. I enjoy traveling as a humbling way to see the variety of ways that humanity chooses to live life and remember that my world view is very much one of many.
