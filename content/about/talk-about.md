title: What I am excited to talk about
order: 4

- **Travel**
- **Coffee**
- **Technology** 
- **Prototyping & spitballing ideas/concepts**
- **Video games** (Starcraft has been a long time friend)
- **Hearing about othersâ€™ entrepreneurial journeys**
- **Things that you care about.** I love talking to people who are passionate about things, even the most frivolous, its fun to dig deep into why you love eclairs so much etc)
- **Why you do what you do.** Similar to the above, I find it interesting how people end up in the career/work they do, it's never linear and usually funny.
