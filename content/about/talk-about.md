- **Coffee** (Is that cliche? Oh well. I live for the stuff.)
- **Technology** 
- **Prototyping & spitballing ideas/concepts**
- **Video games** (Starcraft has been a long time friend)
- **Hearing about others’ entrepreneurial journeys**
- **Travel**
- **Someone else’s passions.** I love talking to people who are excited about things, regardless of what it is. It’s fun to learn about why someone loves what they love.
