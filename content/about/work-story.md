 I first realized my passion for technology when as a kid living in Vietnam I discovered that a benevolent computer vendor had installed a ninja game on our first computer, which I happened to find after combing through the entire directory, opening random files on the computer in DOS. The awesomeness of that game blew my mind. I didn’t know then that that moment of wonder would drive much of my career.

And to be honest, until my early 20s, it was a love of gaming that drove me to keep learning. I first figured out how to network so that I could play LAN games with my brother - GTA2, Counterstrike, and the like. I started building our computers myself and my brother pulled me down the rabbit hole of overclocking them. I decided that getting a [whitebook laptop](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/laptop5.htm)would be a good idea and enjoyed ripping it apart to put in my own CPU / RAM etc. I got so into the computer market while living in India as a teenager that I was on a first name basis with a number of the IT guys on [Richie street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritchie_Street) in Chennai.

With the successes and fun, came some missteps. I remember being pretty sure that the iPhone wasn't going to make it and opted instead for the [HTC TyTN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_TyTN_II), deciding that spending hours of my life modding the ROM would be fruitful. I eventually accepted I was wrong and got an iPhone a year or two later when I couldn't deal with using the Internet through the travesty that was Windows Mobile 6. I’ve since worked with SQL, VBA (never again), Drupal (never again), Wordpress, PHP, Ruby & Rails, Vue, some React and Elixir, as well as all the other fun in between things you do to build technology (i.e. CI, building server environments, etc).

Beyond tech, I love teaching & facilitating, too. In my college days, I taught English in El Salvador, Kyrgyzstan, and China. I found helping others learn a new skill really rewarding. I still try and teach where I can and a lot of my recent work has involved facilitating large workshops and designing online and in-person training using adult learning theory. Facilitation allows me to help people discover new ideas, collaborate in a structure, effective way to make hard decisions, and come to a consensus.

Combining my passion for tech with my facilitation skills is probably where I do my best work. It’s allowed me to build tools that support others in achieving their goals. I try to focus on using tools that meet the needs of what people are trying to achieve vs. over-engineering things for the sake of building shiny objects or dogmatically sticking to a given language or framework because it’s what I know. 

Much of my career has been in International Development - it’s a part of my DNA (even before my parents, my family lived abroad for close to 200 years in India and Iran). But it’s also an industry, for its many flaws, that I believe is at least aspiring to do good in the world and I’ve enjoyed trying to be part of that goal. Through Tela, I’ve recently dug into the healthcare industry and it’s another space in which I’d like to contribute.

Because tech was something I was naturally drawn to and learned through experience, my education focused other things I wanted to explore - business and organization development. I had also found that so much of what made the technology succeed or fail depended on the people side of things more so than the merit of the code base itself. So, I studied how to get people to work together, adopt ideas, manage change, and all the things that could keep me and the tools I built from succeeding.

In sum, I’m proud of the skillset I’ve built - from facilitating large workshops, digging back into the code, selling, managing a backlog, and figuring out to navigate the ups and downs that come with trying to take businesses from an idea to a reality. I'm happiest when I can dive deep into a problem with a team that I can help foster the kind of “its about the process, not output” ethos that I’ve come to find important in life.
